TODO List
=========
 * Reimplement remaining perl scripts into python

 * Look for any xorg-specific or kernel-specific tags, comments, etc.
   and create command line options to allow overriding those.

 * Permit specification of team-specific values in /etc config file

 * Add exception handling to collect-* and process-* scripts
   (see collect-patch-bugs as an example)

 * Set up unittest framework

 * Set up pydoctor support for generating API docs

 * Make collect-patch-bugs also include bug reports that the team is
   subscribed to directly (for cases where team is not subscribed to the
   source package the bug is reported against).
