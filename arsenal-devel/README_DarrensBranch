Arsenal for OIL bugs
====================

Current Code Repository
-----------------------

https://code.launchpad.net/~autonomouse/+junk/arsenal-devel


How to use from command line
----------------------------

- Branch the code from the current code repository (see above)
- Change directory to 'reports' then the project of your choice, foe example: $ cd reports/OIL
- Type: $ ./gen-reports
- An html file with your project name will be generated (i.e. OIL.html). Open this in a browser. 


Known bugs
----------

- The tag filter only works on single tags, so if a bug is tagged with multiple tags (i.e. [charms, cinder-iscsi, juju]), then filtering by juju will not show this bug unless all of them are selected.
