                        === Hook Scripts ===

Arsenal iteratively executes each of the 'hook' scripts listed in a
hooks directory.

It is the responsibility of each script to determine whether the
conditions are appropriate for it to be run.  Simpleminded scripts may
just choose to run each time they are invoked.  Scripts that perform
heavier processing may check the change date on one of its output files
to see if sufficient time has passed to warrant updating it.

Each script is also passed a numerical argument --cycle that it can use
to limit how frequently it should be run.  For instance, a long running
script might choose to run every 10th cycle.  The cycle frequency can be
tuned by the site administer via /etc/arsenal/arsenal.conf or
/etc/arsenal/site.conf, so this provides the user with a single-knob
method of scaling up or down the run frequency to balance load
vs. freshness.

The main process will sleep for a (configurable) period after all
scripts have had a chance to run.  It will also sleep for a
(configurable, typically brief) period between each script.
