  * Fix for repeats - removed extra filters from API call.
  * Add a few promises for sometimes missing data
  * Add initial models/resources for reports

  * Linting and removed bad tests
  * Move html around with jinja includes. No changes other than moving lines and adding the includes lines.
  * Add separate pages for report overview.
  * Fix for bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/weebl/+bug/1553268. Now highlights tab/section when not logged in too.

  * Start of accordion breakup.
  * Port stats over to new search.
  * Get useful information into report accordion.
